pinme
=====

tiny and easy-to-use jquery plugin for pinning an element to the viewport while scrolling - without using position:fixed

This technique is perfect if you are scrolling long parts of content and want some other content (a navigation, a contact block or a call-to-action) stay at the same spot of the screen. 

This way you don't have to scroll back in order to see the pinned content and can access it from any scrolling position on the page.
